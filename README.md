React Native Example App
------------------------

This is a simple example React Native app implementing the [app created for the TSA that picks a random direction](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/04/tsa-spent-47000-on-an-app-that-just-randomly-picks-lanes-for-passengers/).

You can run the app with `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`, provided [all depedencies are installed](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).
